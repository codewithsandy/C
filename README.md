<h2>My C Examples for everyone </h2>

I do consider myself as a programmer. And I create these little programs as experiments to learn with <b>ANSI C</b>, or to solve problems for myself. 
I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me:
